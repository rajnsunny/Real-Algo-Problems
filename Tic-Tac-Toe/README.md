## Rules

Tic-Tac-Toe is a straightforward game with the following rules:

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Two players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell.
3. The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
4. If all the cells are filled, and no player has three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

To play Tic-Tac-Toe:

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the game directory.
3. Run the game using the command-line interface by executing the game's main file (e.g., `python tictactoe.py`).

The game will prompt you to enter your moves by specifying the row and column where you want to place your symbol. The game will alternate between Player X and Player O. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves.

## Game Interface

The game interface is a simple text-based grid. Here's what you can expect:

```
 1 | 2 | 3
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9
```

Each cell is represented by its corresponding number. When it's your turn, you will be prompted to enter the number of the cell where you want to place your symbol.

## Winning Conditions

To win the game, you must get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. Here are some examples:

```
 X | X | X
-----------
 O | O |  
-----------
   |   |  
```

In this case, Player X wins by getting three X's in a horizontal row.

```
 X | O | O
-----------
 X |   |  
-----------
 X |   |  
```

Here, Player X wins with three X's in a vertical column.

```
 X | O |  
-----------
   | X | O
-----------
  O |   | X
```

In this example, Player X wins with three X's in a diagonal row.

## Installation

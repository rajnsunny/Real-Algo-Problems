## Rules

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game with the following rules:

1. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand: "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
2. The game has three possible outcomes other than a tie:
   - Rock crushes scissors (Rock wins)
   - Scissors cut paper (Scissors win)
   - Paper covers rock (Paper wins)
3. If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie, and it's typically played again.

## How to Play

To play Rock, Paper, Scissors:

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the game directory.
3. Run the game using the command-line interface by executing the game's main file (e.g., `python rock_paper_scissors.py`).

The game will prompt you to make your choice by typing "rock," "paper," or "scissors." The computer will also make its choice. The game will then determine the winner or declare a tie.

## Game Interface

The game interface is simple and text-based. Here's what you can expect:

```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!

Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): [Your Input]
Computer chose: [Computer's Choice]
Result: [Game Outcome]
```

The game will display your choice, the computer's choice, and the outcome of the game.

## Winning Conditions

To win the game, you must choose the shape that beats the computer's choice based on the rules mentioned earlier. Here are some examples:

- You choose "rock," and the computer chooses "scissors." (Rock crushes scissors, so you win.)
- You choose "scissors," and the computer chooses "paper." (Scissors cut paper, so you win.)
- You choose "paper," and the computer chooses "rock." (Paper covers rock, so you win.)

If both you and the computer choose the same shape (e.g., both choose "rock"), the game is a tie.

## Installation

No installation is required. You only need a Python interpreter to run the game. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
